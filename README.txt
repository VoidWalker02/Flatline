Flatline is a simple bash script designed to make launching flatpak applications from the command line simpler.
The script creates an alias for all currently installed flatpak packages into your bash config
This makes running these applications far easier, as you need to, for example, type simply:

Obsidian

Into the command line to launch the flatpak Obsidian package instead of typing:

flatpak run md.obsidian.Obsidian

This works similarly for every currently installed flatpak package.
